This repository contains the code and supporting documents used to classify sea ice and leads in remotely sensed altimetry data. We use Machine Learning methods, in particular the Gaussian Mixture Model.

The code is based on a jupyter notebook written by [Weibin Chen](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/research-students/weibin-chen) and [Connor Nelson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/research-students/connor-nelson) for [Michel Tsamados's](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/academic/dr-michel-tsamados) AI for Earth Observation Module
